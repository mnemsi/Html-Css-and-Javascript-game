*The rock, paper scissors game is the idea of a deveoper that I found on youtube, please check he's youtube at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0tRdbXVDbhaRvZPKsRgmxg 

*This game is one person game, which the player will play against the computer.
*The computer choices are 100% randomly generated. There is no trick in case you lost ;)
